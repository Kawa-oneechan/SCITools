0	0	0	1	99	That would probably do something, but nothing you need to worry about.

0	1	0	1	99	You see nothing special.
0	5	0	1	99	You don't need to take that.
0	2	0	1	99	You can think of nothing to say to that.
0	3	0	1	99	Where were you trying to go?
0	6	0	1	99	You wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole.
0	6	0	2	99	And you're certainly ill-equipped!

2	0	0	1	1	Hey! Why'd you do that to me?
2	15	0	1	1	What a coincidence. I have one exactly like that!
2	10	0	1	26	(I could wear this, but it wouldn't dangle freely away from MY chest!)
2	27	0	1	1	Oh, yeah. Good idea. Electrocute me, why don't you!?
2	63	0	1	99	You carefully buff that persistent hangnail completely off your finger!
2	63	0	2	1	YEOW! That file is tough!
2	25	0	1	99	You touch one terminal with your tongue and the other with your nose, but you still can't get a charge out of life!
2	48	0	1	99	You COULD wear the inflatable beaver… IF you were in the pool and IF it was inflated!
2	9	0	1	99	(SOUNDFX) Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
2	9	0	2	1	Ahhhhhh!
2	16	0	1	1	”I've got rings on my fingers and bracelets on my…” Wait a minute.
2	54	0	1	99	Rubbing the brochure filled with photos of naked chicks all over your body will do nothing to further your immediate goals!
2	54	0	2	26	(No, but it's kinda fun!)
2	65	0	1	99	Here? Now? Why?
2	26	0	1	99	You briefly consider forming the cord into a noose and looping it around your neck, but decide you're not doing THAT badly yet!
2	20	0	1	1	Hey, man! Good idea. I was thirsty!
2	20	0	2	99	But just in the nick of time, you stop because you refuse to drink alone!
2	20	0	3	1	Awwwh!
2	37	0	1	1	Ah! That feels cool.
2	4	0	1	1	Hee hee. That tickles!
2	4	0	2	1	Ohhhh!
2	4	0	3	1	OHHHHHHH!!
2	4	0	4	1	Hey, you really like that, don't you?
2	4	0	5	99	Could you just wait a little while before we do that again?
2	4	0	6	99	Stop playing with yourself.
2	22	0	1	99	You already wore that once. And once is enough!
2	40	0	1	99	You could pour a little on your hips, but you already have cellulite to spare!
2	32	0	1	99	You refuse to wear a cellulite-clogged filter on your head like a lampshade at a bad cocktail party!
2	60	0	1	99	Being especially careful around your incisors, you rid your mouth of all dangerous plaque.
2	66	0	1	99	Mmmmm. These are redolent.
2	66	0	2	26	(Was I supposed to pack a thesaurus?)
2	49	0	1	99	Wearing your beaver is a good idea, but try doing it in the pool.
2	49	22	1	99	You're already on your beaver!
2	18	0	1	99	You don't really want to wear the gown.
2	18	0	2	1	Whew! Thank God! I was afraid I was gonna have do another drag scene, like in “Leisure Suit Larry 2 & 3.”
2	12	0	1	99	You could lock the handcuffs around your wrists, but wouldn't that slow down the game a lot?!
2	59	0	1	99	You rub the Al Lowe Vera lotion into a few of those dry places on your knuckles.
2	59	1	1	99	You rub the Al Lowe Vera lotion into a few of the many wounds Thunderbird inflicted upon you.
2	58	0	1	99	Don't chance damaging that delicate impression you made!
2	52	0	1	1	
2	39	0	1	99	You could bang your head with the lamp but you might hurt it.
2	39	0	2	1	My head or the lamp?
2	39	0	3	99	Guess!
2	30	0	1	99	Considering a little self-gratifying Mazola party?
2	41	0	1	1	
2	43	0	1	1	OUCH! That's hot!
2	1	0	1	99	You pause for just a moment to study the one who loves you most…
2	1	0	2	99	…you.
2	17	0	1	99	You're plenty lubed already!
2	42	0	1	99	You try to strike the match by rubbing it on your trousers, but polyester just isn't rough enough to start it burning.
2	38	0	1	99	You may be thirsty, but your hunger for something else is stronger. Take that water to Gammie!
2	34	0	1	99	Even though you are getting a little hungry, you decide to save the orange for future use.
2	13	0	1	99	Mmmmm. This orchid is redolent.
2	13	0	2	26	(Was I supposed to pack a thesaurus?)
2	46	0	1	99	This tiny swatch of cloth was “included free with the purchase of any pair of sunglasses.”
2	46	0	2	26	(Tiny? It's not THAT tiny. There are guys out at the pool wearing swimsuits smaller than that!)
2	51	0	1	1	
2	7	0	1	99	You surreptitiously wriggle the key around inside your ear and remove a large blob of ear wax with which you have no idea what to do.
2	7	0	2	1	Oops! Dropped it.
2	57	0	1	99	Sure, you COULD rub the soap all over yourself right now, but wouldn't you really rather wait until you're in the shower?
2	45	0	1	26	(I would look so cool wearing these out by the swimming pool… but not here.)
2	45	5	1	99	You could wear the sunglasses here, but why bother? You don't have time for sunbathing, Larry!
2	47	0	1	99	You wouldn't dare wear that trifling little thing anywhere except poolside. Go out there and change.
2	5	0	1	1	Take me! I'm mine!!
2	2	0	1	1	(MUMBLE SOFTLY) Mozxcoiq fqweyzxc fw zxce wqf.
2	2	0	2	1	(MUMBLE SOFTLY) Now what was it I was supposed to remember?
2	2	0	3	1	(MUMBLE SOFTLY) I wanted to say something, but now I can't remember.
2	2	0	4	1	(MUMBLE SOFTLY) They say this is the first sign of old age!
2	61	0	1	99	You don't really need a dickey!
2	61	0	2	1	WHAT?!
2	61	0	3	99	…made of thin white tissue paper!
2	61	0	4	26	(Whew!)
2	62	0	1	99	Normally one uses that when one's pants are around one's ankles!
2	56	0	1	99	You furtively wipe a few drops of perspiration from your upper lip and hope that no cute babes have noticed.
2	50	0	1	1	
2	35	0	1	99	No one will ever know you wiped your forehead with that washcloth.
2	36	0	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells nice and clean.
2	36	12	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells of diluted beer and label glue!
2	36	14	1	99	Your wet washcloth is brown with stains from that dirty sink water you soaked it in.
2	36	8	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells of briny sea water.
2	36	9	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells like piss!
2	36	10	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells of chlorine.
2	36	13	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells of athlete's foot remedies and chlorine!
2	36	11	1	99	Your wet washcloth smells like crap!
2	64	0	1	99	What's the matter? Got a nut loose?
2	19	0	1	99	
2	6	0	1	99	You carefully adjust your clothing.
2	6	0	2	1	Ahhh.
2	6	0	3	99	You hope no one noticed.
4	4	0	1	99	Trying to jerry-rig the Points-O-Meter™?
4	1	0	1	99	The Points-O-Meter™ shows you how many points you've earned.
4	5	0	1	99	You want to “take away” some points?
4	2	0	1	99	Beg all you want! You're not getting any free points!
