//This example file demonstrates REFERENCES.

//Most other tools I've seen besides Sierra's own don't handle these. At all.
//Referenced lines allow you to use the same line multiple times, while only
//saving it only. Lines that are references are themselves saved as blanks.

//Reference lines can themselves reference more references, up to five levels
//deep. References point to entire sequences, not individual parts.

//To make a line a reference, write "[REF noun verb cond]" in its text field.
//You can use defined names if you want.

//noun	verb	cond	seq	talker	line
1	4	7	1	99	This is line A.
2	5	8	1	99	This is line B.
3	6	9	1	99	[REF 1 4 7] This is line C,
					but it will be stored as a
					reference to line A.
